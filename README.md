# Cross Validation for PCA
 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used
 multivariate techniques for describing and summarizing data. However,
 determining the optimal number of components remains a critical chal
lenge, particularly in the presence of noisy data. While qualitative ap
proaches, such as the scree plot or the percentage of variance explained,
 are commonly employed, their reliability is often limited. In this study, we
 explore quantitative methods for selecting the optimal number of compo
nents, focusing specifically on three cross-validation techniques: Gabriel
 Hold Out, EM and by Matrix Completion. These methods are evaluated
 through simulations on synthetic datasets and subsequently applied to a
 real-world dataset to assess their performance and practicality. Results
 indicate that Gabriel Hold-Out is the most computationally efficient, EM
 is the most robust across noise types, and Matrix Completion provides
 reliable performance, especially in structured noise scenarios. However,
 dataset-specific characteristics, such as sample size and distribution as
sumptions, significantly impact method performance. These findings un
derscore the importance of tailoring PCA approaches to the datasetâ€™s
 properties.
